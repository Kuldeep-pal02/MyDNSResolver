What needs to be implemented as part of this project
1) DNS qyery over UPD:53
2) Constructing DNS packets Manyally
3) Parsing DNS Response Packers
4) Following NS referrals( root -> TLD ->Authoritative )
5) Chaching ( LRU )
6) Parallellism for retires
7) TimeOuts
8) Commonad Line clients like dig 



Core Concept to learn
1) DNS Packet structure
2) UPD Socket Programming
3) Name compression in packets
4) Recusrice vs iterative resolution
5) How DNS chaching works
6) TTL and cache invalidation
7) EDNS basics
8) DNSSEC
